"1","columnar basket","../labels/afairen.txt","This term is not new, I believe. In my view, these cells have a pattern of axonal branching similar to typical basket cells, and also display the curved pre-terminal axons typical of basket cells. At difference with the other types of basket cells (common and large basket cells), their axonal plexus form abundant ascending and descending branches that span several layers. Usually these axons distribute within the space of a column as defined in the proposed manuscript."
